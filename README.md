Weather Checker App

Project Description:
This project is a responsive React web app that lets users see what the temperature and condition of a specific GPS coordinate is and what clothing is appropriate.

Technologies and Techniques Used:
The app is built using React with functional components and React Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext for managing component state and global user data. React Router is used for page navigation, and the app communicates with a backend using fetch for API calls. Conditional rendering is used to control access and content visibility based on user authentication. The project uses CSS with the BEM naming convention for styling and organizing component styles.
